# 1.21.3-1.20.5

## 📘 Custom Model Data – Changes in 1.20.5

In **1.20.5**, custom model data was moved from the old NBT `CustomModelData` tag to a structured `minecraft:custom_model_data` component.\
Command syntax was updated to use square-bracket components while resource pack JSON overrides continued to use `custom_model_data` predicates as before.

***

**In-Game Commands**\
Command syntax was updated to use square-bracket component syntax:

Example:

```
/give @s minecraft:paper[minecraft:custom_model_data=1]
```

The number must match the `"custom_model_data"` value defined in the JSON for the override to take effect.
