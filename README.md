# Welcome to the Packs Index!

### What's this all about? 

The Packs Index is a comprehensive wiki dedicated entirely to Minecraft resource packs—from first-time creation to advanced, production-ready techniques.
Whether you’re making your very first pack or maintaining a large, server-scale resource pack, this index exists to explain how resource packs actually work, not just what files to copy.

Here, you’ll learn how to:

+ Create and structure a resource pack correctly
+ Design and import custom models and textures
+ Work with Custom Model Data and item model overrides
+ Build panoramas, UI assets, and visual elements
+ Understand model predicates, limitations, and quirks
+ Follow best practices for compatibility, organization, and performance
+ Prepare resource packs for servers and long-term updates

The Packs Index is built as an organized reference, not a random collection of tutorials. Each topic focuses on clarity, correctness, and real-world usage—so you understand why something works, not just that it works.

If it’s about resource packs, it belongs here.
