# 1.21.4-Latest

## 📘 Custom Model Data – Changes in 1.21.4

In 1.21.3, custom models were chosen using **one integer**.\
In 1.21.4, this was replaced with a full **data component** that supports multiple value types and smarter model selection.

***

#### Folder Structure

* 1.21.4 introduced an items folder
* Used to separate model function from appearance.
* Whether you are using floats, colors, strings, or flags, the path to the JSON must be the same.
* The new file path for the JSON in 1.21.4+ is: `assets > minecraft > items > paper.json`

> Note: The example filepath above is for paper

#### [**Floats**](1.21.4-latest.md#floats-1)

* Addition of floats
* List of floats for **range-based** model checking.
* Uses a fallback if no range matches.

#### [**Strings**](1.21.4-latest.md#strings-1)

* Addition of strings
* List of strings for **exact-match** selection.
* Falls back if none match.

#### **Flags**

* Addition of flags
* List of booleans for **condition-based** model logic.
* Missing values default to `false`.

#### [**Colors**](1.21.4-latest.md#colors-1)

* Colors rework
* Now supports **float RGB lists** _or_ **integer colors**.
* Missing values use the model’s default tint.

#### In-game Commands

* 1.21.4 changes this lol

## Floats

Floats are the new way in 1.21.4+ to attach a model or texture to an item using **custom model data**. The next step to creating a working resource pack using custom model data floats is understanding the JSON structure and syntax.

Older resource pack models used the `"overrides"` list with `"predicate"` objects to determine when a model should switch based on the Custom Model Data value.

Starting in **Minecraft 1.21.4**, this was replaced with the `"threshold"` system. Instead of a predicate, each override directly declares the **minimum custom model data value** required for that model to load.

Negative values are **not supported**.\
\


**Example paper.json:**

```json
{
  "model": {
    "type": "range_dispatch",
    "property": "minecraft:custom_model_data",
    "entries": [
      {
        "threshold": 1.0,
        "model": {
          "type": "minecraft:model",
          "model": "item/stick_example"
        }
      }
    ],
    "fallback": {
      "type": "minecraft:model",
      "model": "item/paper"
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Always use **perfectly representable floats**, such as: `1.0`, `1.25`,`1.5`,`2.0`. Avoid floats like `1.1`, `1.2`, or `1.3`, since these are not stored exactly in binary and may fail to match correctly. You can also use integers like `1` safely.

In the JSON above, you can see that after `"threshold":` there is a specified float value that game will look for.

The specified path below `"model:"` overrides paper when the custom model data value is equal to 1.0. In this case, the model is located at `"item/stick_example"`.

A fallback model is defined under `"fallback"`, which is the model the game will use if the custom model data value in-game does not match the 'threshold" value defined in the JSON exactly. (`1.0` in this example)

In most scenarios, the fallback should simply be the vanilla model of the item you are modifying, so items without custom model data maintain the unmodified default model and texture.

\
\


## Strings

Strings are a new feature in Minecraft 1.21.4–1.21.10 that allow you to attach a model or texture to an item using **custom model data with named identifiers**. Unlike floats, strings let you easily identify models by name rather than by a numeric value.

Each string corresponds to a **case** in the JSON, and Minecraft will load the model associated with that string. A fallback model is used if no string matches.\
\


**Example paper.json:**

```json
{
  "model": {
    "type": "minecraft:select",
    "property": "minecraft:custom_model_data",
    "cases": [
      {
        "when": "CUSTOM STRING HERE",
        "model": {
          "type": "minecraft:model",
          "model": "item/stick_example"
        }
      }
    ],
    "fallback": {
      "type": "minecraft:model",
      "model": "minecraft:item/paper"
    }
  }
}
```

In the JSON above, the `"when"` field specifies the string value that Minecraft will look for.\
The path under `"model"` defines which model will override the default item when the Custom Model Data string matches. In this example, if the string is `"CUSTOM STRING HERE"`, the model at `"item/stick_example"` will be used.

A fallback model is defined under `"fallback"`, which is the model Minecraft will use if the in-game Custom Model Data string does not match any `"when"` value exactly.

In most cases, the fallback should be the vanilla item model so that items without Custom Model Data remain unchanged.\

## Colors <a href="#colors" id="colors"></a>

Colors are a new feature in Minecraft 1.21.4+ that allow you to tint an item dynamically using custom model data. Unlike strings or floats used for model selection, colors specifically control the visual tint of an item. You can apply a color to all instances of an item, or target just a specific custom model data value.

Each color can be defined either as a float RGB list or as a decimal integer. Missing values fall back to the model’s default tint. Use [this](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_component_format/custom_model_data) site to find a decimal integer or float list. \*\*Do not attempt to use a hexadecimal code.

**Example: paper.json (not using custom model data floats)**

```json
{
  "model": {
    "type": "minecraft:model",
    "model": "minecraft:item/paper",
    "tints": [
      {
        "type": "minecraft:custom_model_data",
        "index": 0,
        "default": [0.6, 0.1, 0.9]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The "index": 0 field tells Minecraft to use the first color from the item’s custom model data. The "default" value provides a fallback if no color is defined in-game. In this example, the paper will be tinted purple.

You can make an item colored only if a specific custom model data value is present:

**Example paper.json (using custom model data floats)**

```json
{
  "model": {
    "type": "minecraft:range_dispatch",
    "property": "minecraft:custom_model_data",
    "entries": [
      {
        "threshold": 1.0,
        "model": {
          "type": "minecraft:model",
          "model": "minecraft:item/paper",
          "tints": [
            {
              "type": "minecraft:custom_model_data",
              "index": 0,
              "default": [0.6, 0.1, 0.9]
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ],
    "fallback": {
      "type": "minecraft:model",
      "model": "minecraft:item/paper"
    }
  }
}
```

> Note: While this JSON uses floats to define the color code, you can also use a decimal code for the colors. If the custom model data is equal to `1.0`, then the paper becomes purple. If the custom model data does not equal `1.0` then the paper remains the default color.

Using floats with colors attached allows items to have their color changed, but not to all items rather just to items that have the matching custom model data float.&#x20;

### In-game Commands (floats etc.)

The custom model data specified in the in-game command must match the data value defined in the JSON file.

In the vanilla give command, the custom model data is specified in the metadata block: `[minecraft:custom_model_data={floats:[1.0f]}]` where the data component `{floats:[1.0f]}` specifies the matching float data value from the JSON file.\


#### Full command example:

```minecraft
/give @s minecraft:paper[minecraft:custom_model_data={floats:[1.0f]}]
```

```minecraft
/give @s minecraft:paper[minecraft:custom_model_data={strings:["CUSTOM STRING HERE"]}]
```
